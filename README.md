Voronoi Centroid Tessellation of 2D Bounded Convex Area in matlab
You can run this file with "VCTexample.m",
The main function is "Vofs.m"
The A,B is the column vector of the x,y coordinate of the 2D bound, the sequence needs to be clockwise and the first and the last number should be the same to insure the closure of the bound.
The x,y is the column vector of the initial point (x,y) coordinates scattered in the 2D bound.
The dx is the degree of convergence of the algorithm, if dx=0.01 , you may get a relatively good result which conforms to the intuition.
